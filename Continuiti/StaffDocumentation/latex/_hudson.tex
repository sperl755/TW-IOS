\-Hudson (\href{http://hudson-ci.org/}{\tt http\-://hudson-\/ci.\-org/}) is a continuous integration server that has a broad set of support and plugins, and is easy to set up. \-You can use \-Hudson to run your \-G\-H\-Unit tests after every checkin, and report the results to your development group in a variety of ways (by email, to \-Campfire, and so on).

\-Here's how to set up \-Hudson with \-G\-H\-Unit.

1. \-Follow the instructions to set up a \-Makefile for your \-G\-H\-Unit project.

2. \-Download {\ttfamily hudson.\-war} from \href{http://hudson-ci.org/.}{\tt http\-://hudson-\/ci.\-org/.} \-Run it with {\ttfamily java -\/jar hudson.\-war}. \-It will start up on \href{http://localhost:8080/}{\tt http\-://localhost\-:8080/}

3. \-Go to {\ttfamily \-Manage \-Hudson -\/$>$ \-Manage \-Plugins} and install whatever plugins you need for your project. \-For instance, you might want to install the \-Git and \-Git\-Hub plugins if you host your code on \-Git\-Hub (\href{http://www.github.com}{\tt http\-://www.\-github.\-com})

4. \-Create a new job for your project and click on {\ttfamily \-Configure}. \-Most of the options are self-\/explanatory or can be figured out with the online help. \-You probably want to configure {\ttfamily \-Source \-Code \-Management}, and then under {\ttfamily \-Build \-Triggers} check {\ttfamily \-Poll \-S\-C\-M} and add a schedule of {\ttfamily $\ast$ $\ast$ $\ast$ $\ast$ $\ast$} (which checks your source control system for new changes once a minute).

5. \-Under {\ttfamily \-Build}, enter the following command\-:

\begin{DoxyVerb}
 make clean && WRITE_JUNIT_XML=YES make test
 \end{DoxyVerb}


6. \-Under {\ttfamily \-Post-\/build \-Actions}, check {\ttfamily \-Publish \-J\-Unit test result report} and enter the following in {\ttfamily \-Test report \-X\-M\-Ls}\-:

\begin{DoxyVerb}
 build/test-results/\*.xml
 \end{DoxyVerb}


\-That's all it takes. \-Check in a change that breaks one of your tests. \-Hudson should detect the change, run a build and test, and then report the failure. \-Fix the test, check in again, and you should see a successful build report.\hypertarget{_hudson_Troubleshooting}{}\section{\-Troubleshooting}\label{_hudson_Troubleshooting}
\-If your \-X\-Code build fails with a set of font-\/related errors, you may be running \-Hudson headless (e.\-g., via an \-S\-S\-H session). \-Launch \-Hudson via \-Terminal.\-app on the build machine (or otherwise attach a \-D\-I\-S\-P\-L\-A\-Y to the session) in order to address this.
